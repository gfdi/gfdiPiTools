All files in this directory except README_gfdi.txt (this file) are from
other authors.  They are included here as some of our scripts use them.

As of this writing (2013-08-28) the only files are from Adafruit.
The upstream source of these is at:

  https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code

Be aware that the versions we include here are not necessarily the
latest.  We only made the decision to keep these files with our own
because a suitable package for Raspbian was not found.  When possible,
we prefer to let the system package manager keep up with the latest
version of external libraries for us.

The indented text below is from the README.md of the github page linked
above:


  Here is a growing collection of libraries and example python scripts
  for controlling a variety of Adafruit electronics with a Raspberry Pi

  In progress!

  Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
  please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
  products from Adafruit!

I take that to mean that the entirety of the repository is released
under the BSD License.  However, there is at least one file in the repo
(Adafruit_CharLCDPlate.py) with a note in the header comment block
reading, "MIT License."  Make of that what you will.

Our understanding is that the code from Adafruit that we include here is
released under one of the BSD licenses.
